### Good day, eh! 👋

I'm a polyglot developer, volunteer FF/EMT, and RIT Computing and Information Technologies alum. My academic focus is data engineering, and music & technology.

### Let's talk! 📬

Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss my work or other interests. I'm also an audio production, backpacking, locksport, and daily driver Linux nerd!
