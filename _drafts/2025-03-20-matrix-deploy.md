## Account Migration

EMS offers an [experimental service](https://ems.element.io/tools/matrix-migration) to migrate to your new account, but it requires handing over the credentials to both your old and new accounts.

**Note:** This guide assumes you will be using [Element](https://element.io/), but should work with some modification for any Matrix client.
